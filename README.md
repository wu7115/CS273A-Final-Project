## Photorealism Style Transfer

Compare three style transfer model and score their performance.
In this project we use Pix2Pix, Enhancing photorealism enhancement (EPE), and Contrastive Unpaired Image Translation (CUT) by letting them learn from the same dataset.
Use SSIM (structural similarity index) and human eyes to evaluate the generated images.
